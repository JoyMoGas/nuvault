# Privacy Policy â€“ Nuvault

**Last updated: September 22, 2025**

Thank you for choosing Nuvault. Your privacy and security are our top priorities. This document explains what data we collect, why we need it, and how we handle it using our secure backend provided by Supabase.

## Information We Collect

To provide our services, we collect the following information:

* **Account Information:**
    * **Email Address:** Used for account creation, authentication, and password recovery.
    * **Hashed Master Password:** Your master password is required for login. We **never** store your master password in plain text. It is hashed securely, meaning we cannot see or recover it.
    * **Username:** A display name you can set and change within the app.

* **Vault Data:**
    * **Encrypted Passwords and Usernames:** Any credentials you store in your vault (service names, usernames, and passwords) are encrypted on your device using your master key **before** being sent to our database. This ensures that only you can decrypt and view your stored passwords.

## How We Use Your Information

* **To Provide Core Services:** Your data is used to securely store, manage, and retrieve your passwords as you use the app.
* **Authentication:** Your email and hashed master password are used to verify your identity for secure login. Our authentication is managed by Supabase.
* **Password Recovery:** If you forget your password, we use Supabase's secure password reset feature, which sends a reset link to your confirmed email address.

## Data Storage and Security

* **Backend Provider:** Nuvault is powered by **Supabase**, a trusted and secure backend-as-a-service provider that implements industry-standard security practices.
* **Encryption:** We employ a dual-layer security model:
    1.  Your vault data is end-to-end encrypted using your master key.
    2.  Your authentication credentials (master password) are securely hashed.
* **Secure Communication:** All communication between the Nuvault app and Supabase servers is encrypted using HTTPS.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or share your personal data with any third parties for marketing or any other purposes.

## Your Rights and Data Control

You have complete control over your data. At any time, you can:
* View, add, edit, and delete individual password entries.
* Change your username.
* Permanently delete your account and all associated data directly from the app's settings.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes.
