# Data and Account Deletion â€“ Nuvault

**Last updated: September 22, 2025**

At Nuvault, we believe you should have complete control over your data. You can delete individual entries or your entire account permanently at any time directly from the app.

## How to Delete Individual Passwords

To remove a specific stored password from your vault:

1.  On the main screen, find the password entry you wish to delete.
2.  **Swipe left** on the entry to reveal the actions.
3.  Tap the **Delete** icon. The entry will be permanently removed.

## How to Delete Your Entire Account

Deleting your account is a permanent action that erases all your data.

1.  Open the Nuvault app and log in.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** screen.
3.  Scroll to the bottom and tap on the **"Delete Account"** button.
4.  Confirm your decision in the prompt.

### What Happens When You Delete Your Account

This action is **irreversible**. When you confirm the deletion:

* Your user account, including your email and username, will be **permanently deleted** from our authentication system (managed by Supabase).
* All of your encrypted vault entries (service names, usernames, and passwords) will be **permanently deleted** from our database.
* We do **not** retain any copies or backups of your account information or vault data after deletion.
